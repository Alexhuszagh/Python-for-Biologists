# Python Objects

Python has a few different data types, including those for representing numbers (integer, or int, and floating point numbers for decimals, or float), text (strings, or str), ordered collections of items that are editable (list), or not editable (tuple), and key-value pairs (dictionaries).

## Int

> Integers, or int, are non-decimal numbers, which can be assigned to variables.
```python
>>> a = 1
>>> print(a)
1
```
