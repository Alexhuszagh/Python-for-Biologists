# Design a Primer

Now we know the basics, let's apply this to a biological problem.

1. Make 500 primers with 20 nucleotides for a target gene sequence below in the appended file, of a format similar to:
cccggaagcgaacgtcgc...

## Break Problem into Parts

1. Represent sequence as data type
2. Grab subset of sequence of primer length
3. Use loops to repeatedly grab sequence subset at a different starting point
4. Translate sequence to complement

## Step 1

**Which data type is best suited to represent the gene sequence**

A. Int

B. Float

C. String

D. Dictionary
